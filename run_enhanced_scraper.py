His ability to make throws from multiple arm angles and his mobility make him the perfect fit for a Titans offense that needs a dynamic playmaker at quarterback. Ward\'s leadership qualities and clutch gene separate him from other prospects in this class.'

His ability to process defenses quickly and make precise throws in tight windows is exactly what the Browns need.
